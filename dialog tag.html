        Lonavala is a hill station surrounded by green valleys in western India near Mumbai. 
           The Karla Caves and the Bhaja Caves are ancient Buddhist shrines carved out of the rock. 
           They feature massive pillars and intricate relief sculptures. 
           South of the Bhaja Caves sits the imposing Lohagad Fort, with its 4 gates. 
           West of here is Bhushi Dam, where water overflows onto a set of steps during rainy season
